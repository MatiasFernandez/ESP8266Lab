Voltage range:

ESP-chip allows 0-1v range
NodeMCU kit includes a voltage divider (220K + 100K resistors) to allow 0-3.3v

My Amica NodeMCU ESP8266 seems to reach maximum ADC value around 3.2v. I had to reduce input voltage to avoid early saturation.

Schematics:

To maximize sensor range I connected the LDR like this:


3.3V ------ LDR ------- A0
                  |
                  |
                  |
                1Kohm resistor
                  |
                  |
                  |
                 GND
